		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		
		<h4>Why Does This Site Exist?</h4>
		<p>
			Prince Therma XVII has recently gained an interest in technology. 
			In addition, he's begun investigating many of the local rumors, such as the so called "metamorphics" or "fields of glass".
		</p>
		
		<h4>What <b>Power</b> Does Prince Therma Have?</h4>
		<p>
			Prince Therma is mostly a figurehead.
			He is not obligated to preform any duties.
			However, he likes to play a supervisory role within many parts of the kingdom operations.
			He is also known as a patron to many of the shops and eateries within the township.
			Although, most of his subject are not likely to know.
		</p>
		
		<h4>I Think I Saw The Prince At <b>The Moo Moo Dojo</b>.</h4>
		<p>
			No you did not.
			The Prince may visit many places, but not the Moo Moo Dojo as it gives him terrible stomach pain.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is <b>Orph Territory</b>?</h4>
		<p>
			Orph is a neighboring state southeast of our Kingdom. 
			They are on the bank of the Therma River.
			They are largely a city with minimal land within its borders. 
			Their neutrality is famous throughout the world, fueled by their markets and culture of commerce.
			Orph has no monarchal system, with just an directly elected city council and a mayoral figure head.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What is <b>Maze</b>?</h4>
		<p>
			The Maze Organization was founded by Prince Therma as an independant offshoot of the Therma Kingdom defense services.
			Their goals are largely for surveying, archiving and expanding defense opportunities.
			Their establishment is largely considered a gift by the kingdom to other states (such as <i>Oprh</i>) who may not be able to provide their own.
			The Maze Organization Sovereign State (also known as  <i>MOS</i>) was partitioned by Therma XVII to allow itself more autonomy and responsibility in actions.
		</p>
		
		<h4>I've heard <b>voices</b> stemming from the <b>temple in the Therma Woods</b></h4>
		<p>
			The abandoned temple in the Therma Woods rests higher on the hills than most things.
			Its elevation was one of the factors leading to its status.
			Needless to say, it wouldn't be accessible to the average person.
			Rumors persist of a "metamorphic" creature in the surrounding areas.
			However, it is most likely a wild fox or small monkey that commonly seen in the area.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What are the <b>"metamorphics"</b> that I've heard people talk about?</h4>
		<p>
			"Metamorphics" are mythological beings that are rumored to be sighted locally.
			They are said to posess fantastical abilities.
			Legend has it that part of the volcanic field was transformed into a patch of glassy beach sand, due to one of these creatures.
			However, due to the danger inherit in the volcanic fields, no one is permitted to enter.
			No one can identify 
		</p>
		
		<h4>What happened to the <b>servers?</b></h4>
		<p>
			The Maze HQ was subject to an attack by a self-declared anarchist.
			A woman had snuck her way into the building and had thrown water on our original server and some of our stored data and photos.
			Currently, Therma and Maze have released a small bounty on this woman.
			However, she has a reputation for being a "blink and you miss her" type.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Was that woman a <b>metamorphic?</b></h4>
		<p>
			"Metamorphics" aren't real, silly. 
			She mostly likely used a bucket stolen from the washrooms.
		</p>
		
		<h4>What was the <b>simulation originally</b>?</h4>
		<p>
			Data was based off of old history and military conflicts elsewhere on the continent.
			The simulation was originally meant to recreate those kind of conflicts.
			Now that said data is now wiped, the Prince has made it a mission to create his own data.
			Maze has advised him that it was not going to be quite the same as historic battles.
			The Prince made the executive descision to reframe the simulation as one of his new exploits.
